  CHAPTER 1 - Revision History
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Thursday, June 20th, 2002 - Version 1.1

Ooooh...I ALWAYS do that! Everytime I say "this is the final version..." 
I always end up updating again! Well I had a good reason too...fixed a 
width problem in the guide, made the format nicer, and updated the legal 
section and contributor info. Oh yah, I also changed the "Version: Done" 
name...I don't know what I was thinking on that one, kinda sounded like 
I was making a baked potato.


Saturday, July 28th, 2001 - Version 1.0  

It turns out that I did find an alarming error. It my haste to get this 
guide posted, I completely forgot about writing Chapter 11! Well it's 
written. Along with those shenanigans, I have added some more details on 
how to post this FAQ on websites which will be a standard section in my 
guides to come. Also added is more information about Robotron bonus 
games. I can now safely say, I'm completely done here.


Friday, July 27th, 2001 - Version 0.9 

I'm completely done with everything in this entire guide. Only way I'd 
update now is if I find an alarming error or something of importance is 
missing. I may update if I get a reader contribution, yeah right... ;)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CHAPTER 2 - Robotron 64 Story 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


-- Coming word for word, straight from the Robotron manual:

ROBOTRON: THE STORY

In 2084, inspired by his never ending quest for progress, man perfects 
The Robotrons, a robot species so advanced that man is inferior to his 
own creation. Guided by their infallible logic, The Robotrons conclude 
the human race is inefficient and therefore, must be destroyed.

You are the last hope of mankind. Due to a genetic engineering error you 
possess superhuman powers. Your mission is to stop the Robotrons and 
save the last human family.  


------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CHAPTER 3 - Your Character and Fellow Characters
------------------------------------------------------------------------


********EUGENE********


You only control one character in Robotron 64, and he is a funny little 
man named Eugene. Eugene -- the Lean, Mean, Robotron Killing Machine. 
Eugene is a genetically enhanced human making him strong enough to fight 
against the evil army of Robotrons. He sports a white suit, black 
gloves, purple-tinted scuba goggles, and a large bald head. However, the 
most important feature of the guy is that he has a powerful pulse cannon 
attached to his left arm. This allows him to destroy the Robotrons. 
Unfortunately, Eugene has no health meter, so touching a Robotron or 
obstacle means instant death. 


********THE LAST HUMAN FAMILY********


The are a few other characters in Robotron 64, but you can't control any 
of them. Walking around the arena will be family members: There's Mom, 
Dad, Little Mikey, and Grandpa. You can only save these members of The 
Last Human Family from being taken away by the Hulk type Robotrons. Just 
touch a family member to rescue it. Each family member gives you a nice 
amount of points too.  


------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CHAPTER 4 - Default Controls
------------------------------------------------------------------------


This section is here to guide you through the extremely versatile, yet 
simple controls of Robotron 64. It's definitely makes fine use of the 
Nintendo 64 controller and a good arcade port. Notice, I said "default" 
controls. Controls may be changed in the Set-Up Menu of the game before 
you begin playing. I don't recommend changing anything until you have at 
least played the game for a few hours.  


********BUTTON FUNCTIONS********


<< Start Button >> 
Pause your game or confirm something on menus.

<< Analog Joystick >> 
Move your character, Eugene, around the arena.
 
<< Directional Control Pad >> 
Same function as the Analog Joystick. For advanced players, I highly 
recommend the joystick over the Control Pad. 
 
<< A and B Buttons >> 
The A Button confirms something on a menu, and the B Button cancels it. 
Unlike most other Nintendo 64 games, you use the camera buttons much 
more then these two.

<< L and R Buttons >>
Change the view of the camera. There's many options, including Arena and 
3rd Person view. Arena view is most superior to viewing all the action 
so you don't get yourself killed.

<< Four Camera Buttons >>
These are the buttons you will be pressing 90% of the time when playing. 
Use there to fire off Eugene's green pulse cannon. 

<< Z Button >>
This is not used at all in Robotron 64. 


********SOME DETAILED FIRING CONTROLS********


From Eugene's position on the Arena, he is able to fire in any direction 
at his enemies. Press the Camera-Up button to fire up, Camera-Left to 
fire left, ect. You get the idea. If you press two camera buttons at the 
same time, like Camera-Right and Camera-Up, Eugene will fire at a 
diagonal angle, very useful for corners...see below:

+-------------+

  CHAPTER 5 - Gameplay Skills
------------------------------------------------------------------------


********ROBOTRONICS 101********


<< Object of Playing >>
The basic idea of gameplay in Robotron 64 is simple. Kill them before 
they kill you. More specifically, every level consists of a simple arena 
either square or octagon shaped. Kill all the Robotrons that appear on 
the arena to move on to the next level. The high the level number, the 
more enemies that appear, the faster they are, and the stronger their 
variety. For complete enemy details, check chapter 8. Your game lasts 
until you beat it, you run out of lives, or you decide to quit. You can 
resume later if preferred. 

<< Keeping Your Character Alive >>
Quite simply, don't get hit! The character you control, Eugene, only has 
one hit. The instant he touches say a mine, or a Robotron, you will lose 
a life. Always stay moving! Learn to gauge how fast the enemies are 
moving and what the safe spots are. A safe spot one moment may be a 
deathtrap the next -- this game takes PRACTICE.

<< The Camera is Your Friend >>
There are many camera views. However, find they camera view you like 
best, and stick with it! If you keep changing you camera, you will get 
distracted and die ("Arena" view is probably the single most versatile).

<< Practice, Practice, Then Practice Some More >>
There's only so much a guide can do for you on a game like this. You 
must have raw skill to beat this game, so practice! It took me a while 
just to beat the game on easy mode...  


********ADVANCED STRATEGIES********


<< Edge Bounce >>
The Edge Bounce move is the move you should be performing 90% of the 
time while playing. Run along all the four or eight (if the stage is one 
of the octagonal ones) edges of the arena constantly firing out at the 
center. This will wipe out most of the enemies. Make sure to fire behind 
yourself occasionally to get rid of ones following your tail.

       Arena                        
+------------------+   C  = Arena center.
|  <-------------  |  --> = Path Eugene is running.
| |              ^ |
| |              | |
| |       C      | |
| |              | |             Sounds simple right?
| v              | |
|  ------------->  |
+------------------+


<< Corner Defense >>
This should be used sparingly, because in the end its almost a death 
sentence for Eugene. The only time you should do it is when the enemies 
are simply moving too fast and you need a last ditch effort to kill as 
many enemies as possible before losing another life. Position Eugene as 
far in a corner as possible. Doesn't matter which one. Then fire at a 45 
degree angle out into the center of the arena. The enemies will filter 
into the corner and be blown to bits. That is, until so many bunch 
together they get past the laser fire and kill Eugene. That usually 
takes a while though, so your sure to take out tons of enemies. 

       Arena                                        
+------------------+   C  = Arena center.
|                  |  --* = Path of the pulse fire.
|      *           |   E  = Eugene's location.
|     /            |
|    /    C        |
|   /              |           ...and, this DOES NOT WORK WITH
|  /               |           the octagonal arenas, as the corners 
|E                 |           are too wide.
+------------------+


<< Outside Loop >> 
This move should only be performed when you have acquired a two-way 
pulse upgrade. See power-up section about that in Chapter 7. Start at 
one of the sides, then immediately run straight down through the middle 
of the arena, with your pulse cannon firing left and right. This will 
kill tons of enemies. When you reach the other side of the arena, loop 
to the outside edge and run along till your two-way runs out.

       Arena                                        
+------------------+   C  = Arena center.
|  ______          |  --> = Path Eugene is running.
| /      \         |   E  = Eugene’s starting location.
| |      |         |
| |      |C        |

+------------------+


------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CHAPTER 6 - Different Level Types
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Levels in the game consist of a basic playing arena. However, as you're 
playing through the game the level backgrounds and some of the obstacles 
will change.


********BONUS GAME********


After you beat 20 levels, you will be able to play a bonus game. This 
consists of Eugene placed on an arena, with enemies randomly appearing 
and running in at high speed...take out as many as possible for tons of 
points and 1-UP life bonuses. YOU CANNOT die. All the Robotrons only 
take one or two hits to destroy and Bee Robotrons are only found in the 
bonus games.


********EASY MODE******** 


LEVELS 30-40 take place in the Electrode Forest. Arenas are square but 
contain large amounts of electrodes scattered about. Oh, and the 
electrodes are large too!

LEVELS 40-50 take place in the Beam Maze. Arenas have beam posts 
scattered around, which sometimes create a beam between them...touch the 
beam and DIE.

LEVEL 50 is infested with tons of Brain enemies. My favorite!

LEVELS 70-80 take place in octagon arenas rather then the standard 
square shaped. Annoying, because the corner defense is useless here.

LEVEL 99 is a "Battle Royale". Encounter large amounts of all the 
enemies you saw in the previous 98 levels. 

LEVEL 100 -- Boss: Fight against the Yellow Guardian. Find out what that 
is in Chapter 9 if you're curious.


-- ENDING: Just tells you to go play normal mode. Oh boy... 


********NORMAL MODE********


LEVELS 30-40 take place in the Electrode Forest. Arenas are square but 
contain large amounts of electrodes scattered about. Oh, and the 
electrodes are large too!

LEVELS 40-50 take place in the Beam Maze. Arenas have beam posts 
scattered around, which sometimes create a beam between them...touch the 
beam and DIE.

LEVEL 50 is infested with tons of Brain enemies. My favorite!

LEVELS 70-80 take place in octagon arenas rather then the standard 
square shaped. Annoying, because the corner defense is useless here.

LEVEL 99 is a "Battle Royale". Encounter large amounts of all the 
enemies you saw in the previous 98 levels. 

LEVEL 100 -- Boss: Fight against the Yellow Guardian. Find out what that 
is in Chapter 9 if you're curious.

LEVEL 101 is "The war continues". Beginning of the next 100 levels. 

LEVELS 130-140 is coming back again to the Electrode Forest. Arenas 
contain EVEN more electrodes, some indestructible.    

LEVELS 140-150 take place a second Beam Maze. Arenas have even more beam 
posts scattered around. Beams appear much more frequently as well...

LEVEL 150 contains tons of every type of Brain enemy. MANY Mega Brains.

LEVELS 170-180 are just more octagon shaped arenas.

LEVEL 199 is a "Battle Royale With Cheese". Encounter tons of every 
enemy-type in the ENTIRE GAME. Perhaps the most frantic level of all and 
a huge barrier to pass! 

LEVEL 200 -- Final Boss: Fight against the Blue Guardian. Find out what 
that is in Chapter 9 if you're curious.


-- ENDING: This one is real. You have saved the last human family! 


And "Insane Mode" is just like normal, but there's even more Robotrons, 
and they're faster...this mode is so hard even the Midway bugtesters can 
only get up to level 153! 
 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CHAPTER 7 - Electrodes and Power-Ups
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Electrodes are objects attached to the arena floor, and if Eugene 
touches one he loses a life. However most of them can be destroyed just 
by shooting'em. Power-ups are items that you collect to temporarily 
enhance Eugene. They appear randomly in the arena, but are more prone to 
appear in the harder levels...


********ELECTRODES********


<< Electrode 1 >>
Four-sided pyramid shaped. Standard type. 

<< Electrode 2 >>
Three-sided pyramid shaped. Standard type. 

<< Electrode 3 >>
Cube shaped. Standard type.

<< Electrode 4 >>
Rectangular prism shaped. Giant sized, found in the Electrode Forest.

<< Electrode 5 >>
Rectangular prism shaped. Standard type.

<< Electrode 6 >>
Multiple spikes on it. Standard type.

<< Electrode 7 >>
Diamond shaped electrode. Quite nasty as it can’t be destroyed.

<< Deflector >>
Metallic gray colored cylinder. If you shoot your pulse cannon at this, 
any fire that hits it will be amplified and deflected in multiple 
directions. Great for taking out huge crowds of Robotrons. The real fun 
is when several Deflectors are close together so a chain reaction 
ensues...hmmmm yummy.

<< Transformer >> 
Gray pin with a white sphere on top. Only found in the Beam maze levels, 
if two of these are close together they will create a beam blocking 
Eugene's path. Destroy them to stop the beams.

<< Mine >> 
Flashing orange square on the arena floor. DON'T TOUCH! These are land 
mines and just one touch will kill Eugene. Some enemies make them...boo.


********POWER-UPS********


<< Shield >> 
Red sphere with two spinning rings around it. If you find one of these, 
immediately grab it! It will let you become invincible for a short 
period of time. Be warned, when Eugene stops flashing you're no longer 
invincible.

<< Two Way >>
Red diamond with two yellow lines. A pulse cannon upgrade for Eugene. 
Grab it and Eugene will be able to fire in two directions at once for a 
short time.

<< Three Way >>
Red diamond with three yellow lines. This is just like a Two Way, except 
it upgrades Eugene's pulse cannon to fire in three lines straight ahead 
of him. Definitely the best Power-Up to take out enemies.

<< Four Way >>
Red diamond with four yellow lines. You shoot in three lines just like a 
Three Way, except you also lay a trail of mines behind you. Yawn I say. 
Sometimes I even accidentally run over my own mine trail!

<< Gas Gun >>
Green and purple gun. Grab the gun and Eugene will fire out a large 
stream of green gas. The gas clouds expand as they move away, killing 
anything in their path. Great on bosses and Mega Brains. Lasts for a 
limited time so make it count! 

<< Flamethrower >>
Looks like a water gun...this is THE cool weapon to have, allow you to 
shoot off a huge stream of hot flames. Totally annihilates any Robotrons 
in close range. 

<< 1-Up >>
Tiny red statue of a person. These are rarely found, and only in the 
hardest of levels. Go for ANY OF THEM!

<< Speed Up >>
Pair of yellow high-top shoes. Getting this item will temporarily allow 
Eugene to run at high speeds around the arena.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CHAPTER 8 - Enemies
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Listed below is every basic enemy you will encounter while playing, 
along with descriptions and strategies to beat them.  


********THE GRUNTS********


The Grunts are the workhorse of the Robotron army and make up about 60% 
of the enemies you will encounter. GRUNT stands for Ground Roving, Unit 
Network Terminator. All four types are weak, but don't under estimate 
the way they attack in large groups. You can be overwhelmed within 
SECONDS in the later levels. 

<< Grunt >> 

Name: Grunt   Health: 1 Hit   Worth: 100 Points

Tiny red and blue colored robot. These guys will always arrive in very 
large groups. This first type of Grunt is the easiest and just shoot it.
         
<< Grunt 2 >> 

Name: Jetpack Grunt   Health: 1 Hit   Worth: 100 Points

Tiny yellow and red colored robot. Like the first type of Grunt, except 
armed with a deadly jetpack. They will rocket into the sky and fly 
around for periods of time, then descend back to the Arena floor. Grunt 
2 is invulnerable when in the air, and watch it's shadow, it may try to 
stomp you to death. Shoot it when it lands back on the ground.
 
<< Grunt 3 >>  

Name: Psychotic Obelisk Grunt   Health: 2 Hits   Worth: 150 Points

Tiny metallic colored robot. Just like the first Grunt except there 
bright metallic shell is hard to miss. Which is good, since they're 
twice as strong, move faster, and STILL arrive in large groups.

<< Grunt 4 >>  

Name: X-Ray Grunt   Health: 2 Hits   Worth: 150 Points

Dark blue and violet colored robot. These are the most annoying types of 
Grunts. There just as strong as Grunt 3, but move faster and don't stand 
out! There dark x-ray shell flashes in and out of visibility causing 
them to sneak up on you if your already preoccupied. Just keep running 
and fire every chance that you get.

<< Grunt 5 >>

Name: Magical Grunt   Health: Mystery   Worth: Mystery

Check out the secrets in chapter 10 for more info.


********THE HULKS (INDESTRUCTABLE)********


These guys are found on practically every level. But luckily, the total 
number of them on the level when you start is the way it stays. You can 
not destroy them, only get out of their way. They sole purpose is to 
hunt down any members of The Last Family and dispose of them, 
permanently. 

<< Hulk >>

Name: Classic Claw Hulk   Health: Unlimited   Score: None

Large green robot armed with two pinching claws. Fairly slow moving, and 
easy to avoid. Just try to scoop up any humans before they get to close 
to those claws. 

<< Hulk 2 >>

Name: Vacuum Hulk   Health: Unlimited   Score: None

Large red and purple robot armed with a vacuum nozzle. Slightly faster 
then the previous Hulk, and it's vacuum has greater range for catching 
prey. When rescuing humans, be careful not to get sucked up yourself!

<< Hulk 3 >>

Name: Masher Hulk   Health: Unlimited   Score: None

Large red and silver robot armed with two hammers. These guy's hammers 
have limited range, but it's very fast and aggressive. It will hunt you 
down if every human is gone...use caution... 

<< Hulk 4 >>

Name: Shredder Hulk    Health: Unlimited   Score: None 

Large metallic robot with a spinning combine at the front of it's body. 
These guys are just plain tough to avoid -- extremely aggressive and 
very fast. There spinning blades have a long reach and they will QUICKLY 
hunt you down when all the humans are gone.


********THE SPHEROIDS******** 


Fast moving and relentless, all types of these guys are annoying. They 
all appear like some form of a floating circular ring and manufacture 
different types of stupid Enforcers, another annoying enemy.

<< Spheroid >>

Name: Spheroid   Health: 2 Hits   Score: 500 Points 

Small red and white colored ring. This first Spheroid is very easy to 
take out and produces Enforcer type enemies. Just shoot it and be done 
with it. 

<< Spheroid 2 >>    

Name: Seeder Spheroid   Health: 5 Hits   Score: 1000 Points

Small white and purple broken-ring. These second type are more of a 
nuisance, but should cause you minimal trouble...take them out before 
they produce too many of the Enforcer 2.

<< Spheroid 3 >>

Name: Gigantoid Spheroid    Health: 10 Hits   Score: 1500 Points

Gigantic purple and white colored ring. This is where these things get 
tricky. This guy is very large, making him MUCH easier to accidentally 
bump into. Not only that, they always move erratically at the edge of 
the Arena. Producing Enforcer 3, you want to concentrate your firepower 
and bring these suckers down fast. 

<< Spheroid 4 >>

Name: Megaroid Spheroid   Health: 20 Hits   Score: 1500 Points

Gigantic white and green broken-ring. Ouch is all I can say! These guys 
are giant-sized, extremely fast, and very hard to hit. They take quite a 
beating before being taken down...don’t let them hang around too long, 
or you will definitely be overwhelmed with the mine-producing Enforcer 4 
that they make. 


********THE ENFORCERS********


They all appear as a small pod of some shape. These guys are more of an 
annoyance then any real threat, however Enforcer 4 can give you quite a 
headache. There sole purpose is to simply disrupt you from blasting the 
other Robotrons.

<< Enforcer 1 >>

Name: Enforcer   Health: 1 Hit   Score: 150 Points

Blue spinning square with four fins. Spawned from Spheroids. What can I 
say, just shoot it. All it will do is try to fly straight into Eugene.

<< Enforcer 2 >>

Name: Seeder Enforcer   Health: 1 Hit   Score: 250 Points

Tan colored pod with four legs. Spawned from Seeder Spheroids. Like the 
first Enforcer, except with the added annoyance that he tries to place 
mines around the arena. Avoid the mines, kill the Enforcer. 

<< Enforcer 3 >>

Name: Electrobot Enforcer   Health: 2 Hits   Score: 300

Large green spinning square with four fins. Spawned from Gigantoid 
Spheroids. This guy is just an upgraded version of Enforcer 1 and will 
rocket straight at you at super speed. Dodge his charge and eliminate 
him as quickly as possible.

<< Enforcer 4 >> 

Name: Deadly Super Seeder Enforcer   Health: 3 Hits   Score: 500 Points

Violet colored pod with four legs. Spawned from Megaroid Spheroids. Run, 
very far away. These guys attempt to get up close to you then enclose 
you with mines... 


********THE BRAINS********


Oh there so squishy and lovable. These guys are the hardest enemy type 
in the game. The range from difficult, to insane to bring down. Their 
brain waves are the most effective weapon in the game.

Brain Wave ~ All of the brain type enemies shoot off little pieces of
             energy that are clear colored. Depending on the Brain type,
             they can shoot many at the same time. These will follow you
             around the Arena like missiles until you destroy them or
             they destroy you. They are not worth any points though.

<< Brain >>

Name: Brain   Health: 1 Hit   Score: 500 Points

White robot with a medium-sized blue head. Your basic Brain enemy. These 
guys can only fire off one Brain Wave at a time and are slow moving. 
They appear in groups however so eliminate them quickly.  
   
<< Brain 2 >>

Name: Surgeon Brain   Health: 2 Hits   Score: 750 Points

White robot with a large pink head. These guys are the most annoying 
type of the Brains, as each fires off two Brain Waves at a time and they 
always appear in groups. Stronger and faster then you average Brain.

<< Brain 3 >>

Name: Mega Brain   Health: 30 Hits   Score: 3000 Points

Giant white robot with a huge green head. This guy is the STRONGEST 
enemy in the game you will face, and also the LARGEST. Lucky for you 
they only appear one at a time or in pairs. Each Mega Brain is capable 
of shooting off over 10 Brain waves at a time. It's going to take at 
least 15 seconds of constant fire to bring this guy down...or, you could 
use a Flamethrower if one is nearby...  

<< Brain 4 >>

Name: Slug Brain   Health: 8 Hits   Score: 1000 Points

Green brain-shaped slug that leaves a trail behind. I don't know what’s 
worse, these guys or the Mega Brains. The Slug Brain may be weaker, but 
it's much more agile then the Mega Brain and shoots off Brain Waves 
faster. They appear in large groups too. Fire at will! 


********THE QUARKS********


Quarks don't attack, and are nothing but floating factories that produce 
tanks.  

<< Quark >>

Name: Quark   Health: 1 Hit   Score: 1000 Points

Purple floating rectangle with a yellow top. Produces your basic Tank 
Robotron. Just get rid of them when they appear on the arena.

<< Quark 2 >>

Name: Turbo Quark   Health: 2 Hits   Score 1500 Points

Sky blue floating rectangle a with yellow top. Moving faster and 
producing more aggressively then the basic Quark, this guy makes Shadow 
Tanks. Shoot it down when you get a chance. 

<< Quark 3 >>

Name: Super Quark   Health: 2 Hits   Score: 2000 Points

Red floating UFO with a flashing top. This guy actually poses some form 
of challenge since it produces Silotron Tanks. They move fast along the 
arena to avoid your fire.

<< Quark 4 >> 

Name: Mega Quark   Health: 3 Hits   Score: 2500 Points 

Green floating UFO with a flashing top. Take a Super Quark, make it 
faster, stronger, more aggressive, and you have the Mega Quark. These 
guys produce the super deadly Ejector Tanks which are trouble enough. 
Quickly annihilate any Mega Quarks before they can spawn tanks.


********THE TANKS********


Produced from the Quarks, the four different types of tanks will make 
you stay quite unpleasant when they hurl their projectiles at you. The 
stronger the tank the stronger their projectile. Good luck getting rid 
of the Ejector Tanks...  

<< Tank >>

Name: Classic Tank   Health: 1 Hit   Score: 200 Points

Dark tan colored tank that shoots off one shell at a time. Not much off 
a trouble at all. Dodge the projectiles and wipe them out.

<< Tank 2 >>

Name: Shadow Tank   Health: 2 Hits   Score: 250 Points

Blue and tan colored tank that shoots off two shells at a time. Fancy 
name for an enemy that's nothing special. Just an upgraded version of 
the first tank.

<< Tank 3 >>

Name: Silotron Tank   Health: 3 Hits   Score: 500 Points

Tank colored with army camouflage that shoots off red tissue-seeking 
missiles. Their fast and effective. When they fire off a missile, it 
will track you around the arena until you get rid of it. Get rid of both 
the projectiles and tanks.  

<< Tank 4 >>

Name: Ejector Tank   Health: 4 Hits   Score: 1000 Points

Gray and tan colored tank with a flashing top. Ejects both Nanobyte and 
Dynobyte fleas into arena which attempt to cling on to your character 
Eugene. You know your in trouble when you get a 1000 points just to kill 
a tank. These guys are definitely the most annoying enemy in the game.


********ADDITIONAL ENEMIES********


<< Nanobyte >>

Name: Nanobyte Flea  Health: 1 Hit   Score: 200 Points

Tiny white and blue flea robot. These guys are nasty little buggers. 
When released into the arena from the Ejector Tanks they follow Eugene 
around and attempt to latch on to him. The more latched on, the slower 
Eugene moves. If Eugene gets five or more on him, you will lose a life.

<< Dynobyte >>

Name: Dynobyte Flea  Health: 1 Hit   Score: 200 Points

Tiny red and white flea robot. If you thought Nanobytes were bad, these 
guys are terrible. If just one of them latches on to Eugene, it explodes 
causing him to lose a life. 

<< Ant >>

Name: Minion Ant   Health: 1 Hit   Score: 100 Points

Red and purple colored ant. These guys are even easier to get rid of 
then Grunts. Just shoot them when they appear in their large groups. 
When the Ants appear, it's a sign your closing in on a Yellow or Blue 
Guardian. 

<< Progs >>

Name: Programmed Human   Health: 1 Hit   Score: None

A human that has gone berserk and is running around the arena. If any 
human happens to be struck by a Brain Wave from one of the Brain 
enemies, then it automatically turns into a Prog. All you can do is kill 
them before they kill you.

  CHAPTER 9 - Yellow and Blue Guardians
------------------------------------------------------------------------


When playing a game of Robotron 64, on level 100 you will encounter the 
first boss of the game, the Yellow Guardian. The Blue Guardian is 
located on level 200.

<< Yellow Guardian >>                 
            
~~ Easy Mode ~~                Difficulty: 4/10
Ignore and avoid the Yellow Guardian and take out the other Robotrons 
that appear. After there all gone, collect power-ups and take out the 
Guardian itself.  

~~ Normal Mode ~~              Difficulty: 6/10
Instead of attacking the Robotrons, immediately collect power-ups and 
concentrate all your firepower on the Guardian. Once it's gone your free 
to get rid of the Robotrons. 

~~ Insane Mode ~~              Difficulty: 10/10
First, I hope that you have at least 10 lives to spare. Second, collect 
every power up that you possibly can and blast anything in sight while 
doing the Wall Bounce move. When things get too fast, do the Corner 
Defense and kill as much as possible. 

<< Blue Guardian >>

~~ Easy Mode ~~                Difficulty: N/A
You don't fight the Blue Guardian when playing easy mode.

~~ Normal Mode ~~              Difficulty: 10/10 
This guy is one tough tub of lard. I wasted 16 lives trying to beat him! 
Just fire at will and run like crazy. A little luck couldn't hurt 
either...you probably wanted a better strategy then that, eh? ;)

~~ Insane Mode ~~              Difficulty: 20/10 
I've never actually beaten this guy without cheating to get to him...

  CHAPTER 10 - Codes, Tricks, and Secrets
------------------------------------------------------------------------


********TRICKS FOR HIGHER SCORES********


<< A Hulking Good Time >>
Even though the Hulk enemies are indestructible, did you know you can 
get some points from them? Make sure to leave at least one enemy in the 
level alive. Preferably a single tank. Now have all the Hulks in the 
level bunch into one group while they are following behind you, then 
fire your pulse cannon at them. Every hit on a Hulk gives you 100 more 
points. Milk every Hulk until they stop giving points.

<< Tank Trouble >>
Similar to the previous trick. Instead of immediately killing a Quark 
enemy, let them continually produce tanks. Kill the tanks for more 
points. You can theoretically do this forever. 

<< Human Saved, is a Human Earned >>
Rescue every single human you possibly can to get massive bonus points. 
Each human is worth a whooping 4000 points -- that's 25% more then 
killing a Mega Brain. 


********SKIPPING LEVELS********


Sometimes, you will be able to warp and skip past levels while playing. 
In certain levels a "Magical Grunt" will appear, which is a Grunt that 
he flashes. Destroy him and a Level Gate will appear, which will warp 
Eugene when he walks into it. You can be warped forward anywhere from 
one to EIGHT levels.
